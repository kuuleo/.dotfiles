* [x] ??WHY am I getting this: - âœ— coc-tsserver coc-tsserver 1.11.6 requires coc.nvim >= >=0.0.82, please update coc.nvim.
#---> because I moved the .zshrc which sourced the aliases so I was actually running vim instead of nvim
* [x] ??WHY am I trying to run the .vim file?
#---> same... because I was running vim
* [x] create a vim-plug directory in temp-config
* [x] move .vim directory to there so that coc and other plugins are being installed... or attempted
