# zsh

**since the typescript language server is working in zsh and not in fish,**
**let's just change back to zsh since my MP20 is to get back to developing drifter.live**
**ASAP**
* [x] move the current zsh files in ~/temp-config/.config/zsh
* .oh-my-zsh
* .p10k.zsh
* .zshrc
* .zsh_history
* .zsh.pre-oh-my-zsh
* .shell.pre- oh-my-zsh
* [x] put changing the default shell to zsh insid the install script
* [x] make a zsh directory
* [x] make a .zsh_plugins.txt file for listing zsh_plugins
* [x] run `antibody bundle < ~/.zsh_plugins.txt > ~/.zsh_plugins.sh
* [x] create a new .zshrc file in ~
* [x] put source ~/.zsh_plugins.sh as the only line of code in .zshrc
* [x] source .zshrc
#I sourcced the .zshrc but I didn't see anything happen#
#WHEN there was only lukechilds/zsh-nvm in the .zsh_plugins.txt file#
* [x] add only romkatv/powerlevel10k since that one has a prompt
* [x] do the pipe bundle to update the .zsh_plugins.sh files
#I don't have to add anything new to .zshrc because it loads all plugins#
* [x] source the .zshrc file again
#powerlevel10k looks like it is working since the command line prompt has icons#
#... but I didn't get a prompt asking for my preferences like (Wiesler)'s video#
